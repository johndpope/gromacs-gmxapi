"""
Provide command line operation for the basic Context.

:func:`commandline` Helper function adds an operation to the work graph
and returns a proxy to the Python interpreter. Imported by :module:`gmx`.

:func:`_commandline` utility function provides callable function object to execute
a command line tool in a subprocess. Imported by :module:`gmx.util` for standalone
operation and by the session runner for work graph execution.

:module:`gmx.context` maps the `gmxapi.commandline` operation to
:func:`_gmxapi_graph_director` in this module to get a Director that can be used
during Session launch.

TODO: I am testing a possible convention for helper function, factory function, and implementation.
For the ``gmxapi`` work graph operation name space, `gmx.context` looks for
operations in ``gmx._<name>``, where *<name>* is the operation name. We will
probably adopt a slightly different convention for the ``gromacs`` name space.
For all other name spaces, the package attempts to import the namespace as a
module and to look for operation implementations as a module attribute matching
the name of the operation. The attribute may be a callable or an object implementing
the Operation interface. Such an object may itself be a module.
(Note this would also provide a gateway to mixing Python and C++ in plugins,
since the namespace module may contain other code or import additional modules.)

The work graph node ``output`` contains a ``file`` port that is
a gmxapiMap output of command line arguments to filenames.

    Configure an executable in a subprocess. Executes when run in an execution
    Context, as part of a work graph or via gmx.run(). Runs in the current
    working directory.

    Shell processing is not enabled, but can be considered for a future version.
    This means that shell expansions such as environment variables, globbing (`*`),
    and other special symbols (like `~` for home directory) are not available.
    This allows a simpler and more robust implementation, as well as a better
    ability to uniquely identify the effects of a command line operation. If you
    think this disallows important use cases, please let us know.

    Arguments:
         arguments : a single tuple (or list) to be the first arguments to `executable`
         input : mapping of command line flags to input filename arguments
         output : mapping of command line flags to output filename arguments

    Arguments are iteratively added to the command line with standard Python
    iteration, so you should use a tuple or list even if you have only one parameter.
    I.e. If you provide a string with `arguments="asdf"` then it will be passed as
    `... "a" "s" "d" "f"`. To pass a single string argument, `arguments=("asdf")`
    or `arguments=["asdf"]`.

    `input` and `output` should be a dictionary with string keys, where the keys
    name command line "flags" or options.

    Example:
        Execute a command named `exe` that takes a flagged option for file name
        (stored in a local Python variable `my_filename`) and an `origin` flag
        that uses the next three arguments to define a vector.

            >>> import gmx
            >>> from gmx import commandline_operation as cli
            >>> my_filename = "somefilename"
            >>> my_op = cli('exe', arguments=['--origin', 1.0, 2.0, 3.0], input={'-f': my_filename})
            >>> gmx.run(my_op)

    Returns:
        An Operation to invoke local subprocess(es)

    Note:
        STDOUT is available if a consuming operation is bound to `output.stdout`.
        STDERR is available if a consuming operation is bound to `output.stderr`.
        Otherwise, STDOUT and/or STDERR is(are) closed when command is called.

    Warning:
        Commands using STDIN cannot be used and is closed when command is called.

    Todo:
        We can be more helpful about managing the work graph for operations, but
        we need to resolve issue #90 and others first.
